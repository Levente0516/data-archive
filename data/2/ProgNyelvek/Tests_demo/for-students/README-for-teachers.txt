Notes for `for-students.zip`.

-   This file will always contain all files that the students need to be given.
    -   So, each week, you'll have to update two files in your Canvas: `for-students.zip` and `labs-THELANGUAGE.html`.
-   Packages are intentionally _not_ given to the students as much as possible.
    -   The HTML description and/or the structural tests indicate which package/folder a given file goes into.
        -   The students are expected to be able to put it in the proper folder.
        -   The students are also expected to write the appropriate import directives into the files.
    -   Broadly by category:
        -   Test suites can be placed in any package, even the default one. As they refer to all other tests, import lines need to be added.
        -   Structural tests don't need imports as they do not directly refer to the other classes. (Rather, they use reflection internally.)
        -   Functional ("common") JUnit tests need to be written by the students most of the time.
            -   A few may be given to the students, such as the (more difficult section of) `FanTest`.
            -   They may have to add simpler tests in there themselves.
            -   They still need to organise their imports.
        -   Sometimes, the source is not provided for the students, only the compiled code (a `.class` or later, possibly a `.jar` file).
            -   As for `.class` files, they need to put them in the proper folders.

General.

-   If you see an active VS Code extension when you're inspecting a student's progress, make them to disable/uninstall it immediately.
    -   Some possible indications: hints (wavy underlines, breadcrumbs, Run/Debug menus), automated compilation (complex, autogenerated commands in the command line).
-   In VS Code, show the students the following: go to Settings, type "Compact", turn off "Compact Folders" if it's on.
    -   This shows all folders, and helps the students with the package/folder correspondence.
